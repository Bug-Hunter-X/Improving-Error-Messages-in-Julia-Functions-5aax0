# Improving Error Messages in Julia Functions

This example demonstrates a common issue in Julia: error handling. While the function correctly identifies and throws an error for invalid input, the error message itself can be enhanced to provide more context to the user.

The original error message is generic, which can make debugging challenging.  The improved version offers a clearer explanation of the problem.
